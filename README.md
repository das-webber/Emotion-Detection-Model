# Emotion Detection Model 

This project is a **Facial Emotion Detection System** built using **TensorFlow/Keras**, **OpenCV**, and **Tkinter**.  
It detects human facial expressions and classifies them into seven categories:

**Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise**


The model weights are too large to store in GitHub directly.
